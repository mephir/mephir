## Hi, I’m Paweł

I use GitHub as my workbench, not as a polished portfolio.

**Here you’ll find:**
- Experiments, prototypes and proof-of-concepts.
- Deep dives into systems, storage, infrastructure and developer tools.
- Code across multiple languages from years of exploration.
- A few pinned projects that are more complete or representative.

**What you won’t find:**
- Tutorial clones.
- Shiny but shallow demos.
- Buzzword-driven projects created just for show.

I’ve always been curious about how things work under the hood. Some repositories may look messy, but they all reflect genuine exploration and learning.
